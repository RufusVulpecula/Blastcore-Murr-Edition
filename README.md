**Blastcore Murr Edition:**

A resource intensive but modern, polished and immersive Blastcore build with lots of error fixes and regular updates.

Features tweaked additional effects from various mods as well as many original ones.

No other mods are required and it should work well with CUP, RHS, ACE, PiR etc. (I use them)

Inspired by Squad's vfx style. All the effects you wished you had from real combat videos can now be yours!

Videos are horrible quality-wise and way outdated. Just see them in game.




**Features:**

CBA settings support for some effects! (Credit: ThomasAngel)

Weather dependent effects (Credit: ThomasAngel)

Enhanced bullet impact effects for various materials

Modern metal spark effects (Goko Ballistic Impact)

Fast blast refraction (Refraction Blast Wave Effect)

Shockwave dust effects

Lingering dust effects for explosions

Stone debris from ground explosions (HopeCore)

Fires and sparks

Heat haze effects for weapons fire and missile flames

Large caliber weapon and rpg fire dust kick-ups

Visual fragmentation effects

Additional vehicle destruction effects. (Arma FXP)

Extended vehicle destruction smokes

Custom made and functional smoke grenades

Consistent effects for all ammunition both vanilla and mods

Many more small and big improvements to existing effects and new ones

Feature complete and almost all effects have been edited or recreated from scratch at this point

No errors popping up in-game or at start

No missing or glitching effects (at least not with your help)

Basically I've thrown in a bunch of awesome mods or their features together and tweaked them to play nice with each other.

I have also written and added many effects from scratch as well. At this point, 70% of the mod is my original work.

ThomasAngel: CBA settings implementation, all scripting work, many bug fixes and guiding me through some modding features. He's awesome!

If any of the mod authors wishes to contact me regarding distributing my edits and build, you are more than welcome. I do not take credit for your work. This mod is mostly an extensive edit. (Maybe not so much at this point though, ahahah)



**Compatibility:**

You should disable all other Blastcore or ArmaFXP related mods in order to avoid conflicts.

If you are using Real Engine by amartyn, you need to delete real_sfx_blast_refract.pbo in order to use my version of blast refraction.

Using the Goko Ballistic Impact would partially conflict but no big issues will arise. At worst my edits to the spark effect would get overwritten.

ACE cook-off module can rarely cause effects spam for autocannon ammo on air vehicles. I've tried to minimize the performance impact and visual disparity however if that happens, it can still look a bit weird and performance will suffer.



**Issues:**

Should be bug-free now! (Thanks to all who gave feedback!)

Performance may degrade in explosion-heavy environments for a few seconds. I've tried to keep it on a reasonable level but increasing the particle count was a must to achieve fidelity in some cases. It is recommended to use "Ultra +3" in objects (video settings) to avoid particles disappearing when max count is reached. You may try "standard" or "low" in particles if you are struggling. However, it should not be really bad in most cases since I do not use any permanent particles.

If you are running small scale operations feel free to use "high" in particles. However if you are running large scale operations with artillery support you will be better-off with "standard"!

If there are any broken/buggy effects or errors please provide the effect type and related information and I'll look into it. (Weapon/ammo type or vehicle. Screenshots are also nice along with information)



**To Do:**

I'm mostly done with the mod at the moment. I am looking to buy "SOG Prairie Fire" at one point and ensure that is compatible as well.

Maybe optimize some effects through CBA and give some performance options.

Version with amplified blast wave effects:
